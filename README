NAME
    Async::ContextSwitcher - helps track execution context in async programs

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple module that helps you carry around execution
    context in async programs.

    Idea is simple:

    *   you create a new context when a new web request comes or whan a new
        message comes from a queue or command line script starts

    *   use "cb_w_context" to create callbacks

    *   correct context restored when your callbacks are called

    *   use "context" to access it

    You can live without it in simple applications It's not something you
    can deal
